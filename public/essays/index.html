        <h1>My Final Project Homework</h1>
    
        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML , CSS and Javascript are the three layers of the modern web page construction.</li>
            <li>These three layers can be described as the 'Structure layer' (HTML), Presentation Layer (CSS) and Behavioral Layer (Javascript).</li>
            <li> In order to create an interactive web page, first the structure of the page needs to be addressed, followed by styling through CSS and then adding actions through Javascript.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is not a programing language. It creates the structure/framework of a web page. This means that it creates a system which identifies and describes various components of a page such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links etc. HTML uses a predefined list of tags to "markup" the document.  Each set of item within angled brackets (< and >) is called a tag. A start tag along with some content and an end tag further makes an HTML element. A simple HTML document consists of a series of these elements.

        <p>Note: The above picture has been taken from w3schools.com.</p>
    
        <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for 'Cascading Stylesheets'. It is used to make the web page visually appealing. This means that fonts, colors, line spacing, background colors/images, page layout etc. are all controlled by CSS which adds 'style' to the page. This refers to the way the document appears on the computer screen as well as a cell phone display, printed on paper etc. The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files. 
            CSS has its own syntax. A stylesheet is made up of one or more style instructions called rules/rule sets. Each rule selects an element and declares how it should look. The parts of a style sheet rule can be described as :
            Selector { property: value; }
            Here, the content within the paranthesis is called the 'declaration'.</p>

        <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>It is used to add 'interactivity' to the web pages.  These include, checking form entries for valid entries, making the browser remember the account details of the user for the next time, altering the contents of the page, the style or behavior as per user response, etc.It is a client-side scripting language which means that it runs on the user's machine and not on the server. It is a dynamic programing language and does not need a compiler for interpretation. The browser reads the code the same way as we do and interprets it. 
            Just like CSS, a script can be embedded directly in a document or saved as a separate file and linked to the document. Both the methods use the 'script' element. A script is made up of a series of statements. A statement is a command that tells the browser what to do.
            A simple statement can be: alert("How are you?");
            This will make the browser display the alert "How are you?"</p>

        <h2>Q2. What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
            <p>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?
                Single Page apps and Multi-page apps are both principal ways of building a website, SPAs being the more modern method. Both the SPAs and the MPAs have their own pros and cons and a choice between them depends on the type of the project, the business goals and which method may help in realizing those goals more effectively.<br><br>
                 
                <b>Single Page App </b><br>It is a JavaScript web app which interacts with the user by either retrieving all the code with a single page load or dynamically loading necessary resources as per the response to the user action and adding it to the existing page. It relies on client-side rendering instead of reloading at any point in the process or giving control to another page. Basically, it load logic in a browser itself rather than the server.Examples of SPA are Facebook, Google maps, Pinterest, Netflix and many more.<br>
                <br><b>Some of the benefits of using Single Page Applications</b>
                <ul>
                   <li><b>Engaging and unique user experience.</b>Mobile-friendly with better user interactions with no need of clicking on endless links.</li>
                   <li><b>Fast and Responsive Design. Dramatically improves the loading time:</b>This is because they dont update the entire page, just the necessary content as per the user actions.</li>
                   <li><b>SPAs are easier to debug.</b>Since these apps are developed on frameworks like React developer tools etc. These tools have their own Chrome developer tools that make debugging easier.</li>
                   <li><b> They are easier to develop and deploy</b>
                 </ul><br>
               <b> Multi-Page Websites or MPAs</b><br>
                These are  more traditional web applications and is mostly very large out of necessity. Due to the large amount of content, they have many levels of depth with multiple links and UIs. Every time the content changes, MPAs require reloading of the page over and over again. This induces a demand for transferring large amount of data between the server and the browser.They are especially popular in E-commerce websites. Some examples of MPAs are Amazon, ebay etc.<br><br>
                
                <b>Some of the benefits of using Single Page Applications</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Better performance in Search Engine Optimization</li>
                        <li>Scalability on content because of no limit on number of pages.</li>
                        <li>MPAs can provide better and valuable insights on website performance through the use of Analytics.</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

        <h2>What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
           <p>A Website Designer envisions the look and feel of the website. A Front End Developer builds what we see on a website while a Back End Developer builds the infrastructure for it. The Front End Developers write code which runs on the user's browser while the Back End Developers write code which runs on the web server.<br>
           <br><b>Web Designer</b><br>A web designer's job is to design the websites. The work range is pretty broad. Their responsibilities ranges from designing the mockups using tools like Photoshop, Figma etc. to code POCs using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br><br>
           <b>Some of the skills required are:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating engaging and responsive design</li>
                <li>Integrating client CMS programs and data feeds into websites</li>
                <li>Optimising sites for maximum speed and scalability</li>
                <li>Employing industry and design best practice through website build process</li>
                <li>Conducting website testing</li>
                <li>Working with marketing and research teams to incorporate brand elements and relevant market research findings into website</li>
                <li>Providing internal support and external customer service throughout the build and launch process of the website</li>
            </ul><br>
            <b>Front End Developer</b><br>
            Front end Developers work on "Client side development. They create elements of the website which are directly viewable by the users. These may include visual as well as interactive features like layouts, buttons, navigation etc., basically anything which enhances user experience and gives a seamless navigation. They use primarily three coding languages:  HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some front-end developers may create the mockup designs too while others may code the websites after getting the mockups from web designers.<br><br><b>Some of the skills required are:</b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Front End Programming Languages</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of testing and debugging</li>
                    <li>Creating responsive design which appears properly across different platforms as well as browsers.</li>
                    <li>Understanding of front end development tools and features like automation, content management systems, version control systems, API and Frameworks</li>
                </ul><br>
            <b>Back End Developer</b><br>
            Back End Developers address the server side web application logic and integrations. They monitor the functioning of the website work on updates to improve the behind-the scenes functionality. They typically require a strong knowledge of programming. They work on more advanced programming languages like Java, C++, Ruby, Python etc.<br><br>
            <b> Some of the following skills required are: </b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Database management</li>
                    <li>Framework Utilization</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of accessibility and security compliance</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Distinguish the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative and Absolute Paths</h2>
            <p>These are the three different ways of creating paths used for linking<br><br>
                <b>Absolute Path</b><br> An absolute path is the completPathe path which starts from the web root, irrespective of the current working directory. It is used for referencing external resources which are on a domain other than the home domain. Absolute paths contain the complete information required  to find the resources indicated by an absolute url. For eg., C:\Documents\image.jpg<br><br>
                <b>Document Relative Path</b><br>This method of linking can be used to link a document to another by specifying the path through a folder hierarchy from the current document to the document to be linked. They are used when defining the paths in case when the current document  and the the document to be linked to are in the same folder and are likely to remain together.  The portion of the path which they share is not specified and only the portion which differs is specified. In a scenario where we move the entire folder, all the files existing in it retain the same relative paths to each other. In case a specific file is moved that is linked to by a document-relative link, links would need to be updated. The advantage of linking through this method is portability and it speeds up the page load time.eg., images/image-01.jpg<br><br>
                <b>Site Relative</b><br>The links are provided as paths relative to the root of the current domain. It is quite useful in Websites in which files need to be frequently moved from one folder to another.  They are the easiest to use in Local Sites as they offer a lot of flexibility, will allow a tag to work in pages anywhere on the site without requiring editing path. They use a single forward slash at the beginning to signify the root directory.For eg., /images/image-01.jpg

        <h2>Final Project Description</h2>
            <p>I am designing a website for a small architectural company, 'Studio Jade Architects and Interior Designers' currently residing in New Delhi, India. This is one of my very close friend's company and we have been discussing about designing a website for it since quite some time. I want to take up this project because I feel that since I have the required understanding of the content, being an architect myself, I could use my majority of time to focus on the coding skills required to come up with the right features necessary in building up an engaging site.<br>I have tried to broadly come up with the sections of the site. Perhaps will refine it further till the next class.

        <h2>What it means for a company to be Agile. What is the purpose of using Agile, and its Pros and Cons.</h2>
            <p>Agile and Waterfall are two different ways of delivering projects.<br>Agile is a set of principles and values which is related to product development. In an agile company, the deliverable is produced and accepted incrementally and in rapid cycles, around short iterations  (usually 2-4 weeks).  Also, in agile, the requirements are generally fully defined at the start of every iteration rather than at the start of the project in a single requirements phase (like in the waterfall method). The requirements will then be broken down into discrete items to be fully defined and developed with iterations. One key aim of the agile process is to maintaing the maximum flexibity possible in the whole development process.<br><br>
            <b>Purpose of using Agile</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>It gives team the opportunity to learn with each iteration</li>
                <li>Helps in prioritizing work and features effectively</li>
                <li>Process is fast and flexible which increases productivity</li>
                <li>Supports regular and collaborative troubleshooting</li>
                <li>Teams can make quick corrections as per the stakeholder feedback</li>
                <li>Involves feedback from the stakeholders and client at every step without holding the project up because feedaback is part of the process</li>
                <li>Teams can get quick feedback from each iteration </li>
                <li>Empowers team to work effectively and creatively</li>
            </ul>
                
                <b>Advantages of Agile</b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Continuous Visibility:</b> Since the  agile delivery is in discreet, tested steps, customer satisfaction is checked at every phase of the project span.</li>
                    <li><b>Continuous (modular) testing:</b>Agile testing is also done incrementally as each portion gets developed, so that the changes can be implemented rapidly over short-term steps.</li>
                    <li><b>Rapid Delivery:</b> It is possible to deliver functioning solutions in weeks using this methodology.</li> 
                    <li><b> Effective Short-term Planning:</b> In case a problem originates in the implementation of a product feature, it can be planned as per part of the next sprint/iteration.</li> 
                    <li><b>Flexible Change Management:</b> In agile development, changes happens in stages. Working in discrete steps means that rolling back a step can be done in a quicker and easier way.</li> 
                </ul><br>
                <b>Disadvantages of Agile</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cultural Change:</b>Agile requires high level of collaborations and a disciplined team which can stand in stark contrast with the traditional methods since this need may not always be very feasible.</li>
                    <li><b>Lack of clarity can lead to problems:</b>Agile depends on the clarity of purpose from the client. If the expected outcome is not clear, the project can go off-track.</li>
                    <li><b>Advanced skills needed:</b> Only senior programmers are capable of taking the kind of decisions involved in the agile development process leaving no place for new programmers unless they are combined with external resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Insufficient Training:</b>Agile is still a prescriptive model and training and experience is vital to project success.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                
        <h2>Define the following roles: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, UX designer, Web Developer/Engineer, Quality Assurance Tester, and DevOps.</h2>
            <p><b>Project Manager</b><br>
                The project manager's role is wide ranging. The responsibilities include day-to-day management of the project and must be competent in managing the six aspects of a project, i.e. scope, schedule, finance, risk, quality and resources. They are involved in:<br>

This is done with an aim to help the company make more money, solve their existing business problems and find ways ton achieve their goals in a better manner. The work of a business analyst is very closely related to the IT sector. A business analyst will typically do the following :<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand what the business does and how it does it by conducting research.</li>
                        <li>Determine how to improve the existing business processes using data modelling techniques.</li>

                <b>Scrum Master</b><br>
                Scrum is an agile development framework. Scrum is the framework while agile is a mindset. It is a set of meetings, tools and roles that works in sync to help teams structure and manage their work. A scrum team has three specific roles: product owner, scrum master and development team. The development team includes testers, designers, UX specialists, ops engineers apart from developers.<br>
                Scrum masters coach their teams , product owners, and the business on the scrum process, and looks for ways to fine-tune the practice of it. An effective scrum master can help their teams optimize transparency and delivery flow. As the facilitator-in-chief, he/she schedules the needed resources (both human and logistical) for sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and the sprint retrospective.<br><br>
                <b>UX Designer</b><br>
                They are generalists who cover a little of everything in the entire design process. In large companies, a UX designer typically works with other designers like UX researchers and visual designers. In smaller companies, they may tend to handle all the design work. Their tasks include:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducting user research, analyzing data and identifying pain points</li>

        <h2>What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and SVG images?</h2>
            <p><b>JPEG/JPG</b><br>
                JPEG or JPG is an acronym for Joint Photographic Expert Groups. This is a very common image format. It takes up very little storage space, and is quick to upload or download.It is a 24-bit image format which means that JPEG can incorporate and display millions of colors - 16.8 million colors to be precise. It is very suitable to use this format in photographs and complex images. Basically any photo where color variances are important. JPGs  should not be used if the image needs transparency, have text in them, is animated or would benefit from color changes (like logos or icons).
                JPEG stores data in a lossy format which means that when data is compressed, unnecessary information gets deleted from the file permanently. That means that some quality will be lost or compromised when any file is converted to a JPG.<br><br>
                <b>GIF</b><br>
                GIF stands for 'Graphics Interchange Format'. GIFs are 'lossless' which means that they retain all the data contained in a file. GIF files are limited to a maximum palette of 256 colors.  Thus, not ideal for photographs or images with a lot of colors. GIF can however be used for graphics with a low pixel to pixel variation like logos, icons and flags. It is great for simple animations. Unlike JPEG, GIFs are 'lossless' which means that they support compression without any loss of data.GIF supports transparency. However the transparency is not selective.<br><br>
                <b>PNG</b><br>
                PNG or Portable Network Graphics is an image format designed for the web. It takes the best part of JPEG and GIF. It supports transparency in browsers and is non-lossy that is images can be compressed without degrading the quality. PNG supports 8-bit color like GIF, but also supports 24-bit color RGB like JPEG. PNG comes in 2 formats: PNG-8 and PNG-24. The major difference between the two formats is the number of colors supported by each. PNG-8 can display a max of 256 colors while PNG-24 can display millions of colors. Use of PNG can be found in web graphics which requires transparency, color heavy photographs and images that require re-editing and re-exporting. It also supports embedded short texts. Search engines may find this useful to filter based on the content of the embedded texts.<br><br>
                <b>SVG</b><br>
                SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is a vector format. SVG is written in XML-based markup and is very different compared to the other formats. SVGs are very scalable. Unlike the other formats, SVGs are made of mathematically declared shapes and curves. Hence, there is no pixel limitation. SVGs can be modified using CSS and JavaScript and can also be animated. They are typically of smaller sizes. The size of the file depends on the complexity of the image and not on how large it is.  SVG is thus best suited for logos, icons, charts, graphics etc. that consists of lines and shapes compared to JPEG and PNG. However for a more complex image like a photograph, this format might not be an ideal one.

        <h2>What are testing environments? What is the difference between Local, Dev, QA and Production?</h2>
            <p><b>Testing environments</b><br>
                A testing environment is a space where you can test any change, update, fix bugs to validate the application before forwarding it into release. The test environment includes the software as well as hardware with the appropriate configuration settings<br><br>
                <b>Local </b><br>
                During the development phase of a programming project, i.e., writing code and testing it, data scientists and software engineers often code on their local machine (computer). The machine is usually a laptop or desktop running a non-server operating system. The local environment is under the full control of the individual developer because :
                <ul>
                    <li>Its easy to quickly test, debug and update code.</li>
                    <li>A developer can work without affecting the work of other developers.</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Dev </b><br>
                Development Environment  is the shared location for all the developers to check their code against all the changes of the release. This is known as integration testing. A common practice today is to automate the tests such that after the codes are updated to the repository and there are no errors building, the application automatically builds up and the integration tests automatically gets executed.
                <br><br>
                <b>QA</b><br>
                Stable versions of the build are released to the QA environment for a rigorous functional, integration, regression and other types of testing. This environment can be further tested by splitting it into two different environments: QA and Pre-Production. The bulk of the application testing efforts occur in the QA environment, and the bugs logged refers to the issues found in this environment. It is an important step to make sure of the software release readiness.<br><br>
                <b>Production</b><br>
                The Production environment is configured to host the latest released code and its enhanced functionality to the users. It is hosted on a live server and must work smoothly and without any issues in order to provide a pleasant end-user experience. While successive builds of the application are being tested in the QA and Dev environment, the app continues to run unaffected in production.  This version preferably does not change except for during scheduled releases.
